# BLETools #

## Project Status: Experimental Build ðŸ”¬ ##
This fork revitalizes the original BLESuite with modern tooling. Core systems are undergoing architectural shiftsâ€”consider this a high-potential prototype where bold ideas meet unstable code. Not for production yet, but perfect for pioneers.

## Overview ##

This fork of BLESuite aims to preserve its vision of flexible Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) testing while updating it for modern Python environments and dependencies. Our primary goals are:

- Python 3.12+ compatibility;

- Dependency detox (phasing out legacy libraries)

- Modular design for future protocol extensions

- Developer-first tooling for packet crafting/analysis

_Think of this as a sandbox for Bluetooth Low Energyâ€™s edgy edge cases xD_
## Inherited DNA ##

Preserving BLESuiteâ€™s original ethos of protocol-layer creativity:

- Dual-Role Play: Switch between Central/Peripheral roles fluidly

- Protocol Sculptor: Craft valid or malicious L2CAP/ATT packets

- GATT Labs: Rapidly prototype servers to mimic real-world devices

- Security Playground: Test pairing modes and key negotiation
## Why Rebuild? ##

BLESuiteâ€™s pioneering spirit was shackled by:

- Python 2.x relics complicating modern workflows

- PyBT dependencies with decaying support

- Monolithic patterns hindering async/await integration
  
- Old packaging methods that your grandma used
## Known Gaps ##

- HCI layer behaves unpredictable
  
- GATT service initialization may crash poetically

- Scanning utilities may detect ghosts
  
- Documentation exists in quantum superposition
## Seeking: ##

- Protocol archaeologists (Bluetooth 4.0/5.x expertise)
  
- Pythonistas who dream in async coroutines
  
- Someone to exorcise dependency demons

- Autistic people with Bluetooth hyperfocus
- 
_This isnâ€™t a projectâ€”itâ€™s a protocol renaissance. Letâ€™s rewrite the layers._

Respects the original BLESuiteâ€™s legacy while forging tools for tomorrowâ€™s BLE challenges.
